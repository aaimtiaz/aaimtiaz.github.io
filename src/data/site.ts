/** Single typed source of truth for identity, credentials and links.
 *
 *  Everything here is drawn from the CV (Ahmad_CV_CASSA.pdf) and the CASSA
 *  end-of-term GRA report. These are page facts, not collection entries, so
 *  they are not draft-gated — the homepage and /cv/ can show them immediately
 *  while the teaching/outreach/travel posts stay hidden.
 *
 *  The values live in site.json rather than here. This file used to hold them
 *  as `as const` literals, which meant the in-page editor could only change
 *  them by rewriting TypeScript from a browser — parsing and patching source
 *  code to edit a job title. JSON is data, so the editor writes it back the
 *  same way it writes a Markdown file, and this module stays the typed door
 *  everything else imports through.
